# XAML basics - tutorial sample code

This folder contains simplified versions of the complete PhotoLab sample which serve as starting points for a series of XAML basics tutorials. 
This simplification makes the code easier to browse around in as you go through each tutorial.

Also, be sure to check out the complete sample to see additional features such as custom animations and phone support.
